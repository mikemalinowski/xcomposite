"""
This example attempts to show the composition pattern by demonstrating
a situation where we want to utilise class encapsulation for different
aspects of available functionality but in a way which does not enforce
complex inheritence hierachies.

Instead we utilise the composition class to create a side-by-side class
binding where we do not define a hierarchy between classes.
